The topology to be completed with given conditions

1. Hostnames to be configured as SW1, R0, R1, L3_SW
2. Gateway for all VLAN will last usable IP address of the Network
192.168.1.238 vlan 10
192.168.2.190 vlan 20
192.168.3.254 vlan 30
192.168.4.222 vlan 40

3. Host ip for all hosts will be 1st Usable IP address of the network
192.168.1.225
192.168.2.129
192.168.3.241
192.168.4.193

4. For network between R0 and R1 will be 
	 (i) 192.168.100.0/24 will subnetted into VLSM with minimum usable IPs of 15(no-of unsable IP should not be more than usable IPs)
	192.168.100.0/27
	(ii) Use 3rd subnet 
	192.168.100.64/27
        (iii) 3rd usable ip address will be assigned to R0
	192.168.100.67
        (iv)  last usable ip address will be assigned to R1
	192.168.100.94
5. R0 will be configured with OPSF using Network statement, and router-id will be 1.1.1.1
6. R1 will be configured with OSPF, router-id will be automatically choosen as 2.2.2.2 and network will be advartised using default network statement
7. L3SW will be configure with OSPF with interface advertisement, router-id should be 3.3.3.3
8. Static route for VLAN 30 network will be configured on R0
9. Floating static route for VLAN 40 network with AD of 150 will be configured on R1
10. Default static route towards R1 will be configured on L3SW
--------------------------------------------------------------------
11. DR for link between R1 and L3SW will be R1 (be configured using priority), L3SW should never become DR/BDR between R1 and L3SW
12. NO DR/BDR will be elected in between R0 and R1
